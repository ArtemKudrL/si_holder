# Powder diffractometer silicon holder reflex modeling
Silicon holder python
you need g++ compiller
and matplotlib & numpy

python doesn't looks good, but cpp works nice

you actually need only:
main.cp
func.cpp
vector.cpp
quaternion.cpp

header.hpp
vector.hpp
quaternion.hpp

lattice.dat
spectrum.dat

interafce.py

tests for vector and quaternion classes is optional (if you need to sure that they are working as they should)

other files will appear when you run interface.py

USAGE:
TO START RUN:
python3 interface.py

OR (if previous didn't work):
python interface.py
